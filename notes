4 main types of data warehousing fact tables
	- transanction fact table
	- periodic snapshot fact tables
	- accumulating snapshop fact tables
	- factless fact tables
	
Transaction table:
	- the fact table will usually contain measurements and keys that will reference other 
	  dimensional table
	- for example in a "tuition payment" setting, you will have a tuition_payment_fact table
	  that contains the tuition payment (measurements) and the student/date keys that
	  reference the student and date dimensional tables. 
	  	- the student and date dimensional table each will contain more data on students
	  	  and dates

Periodic Snapshot Fact Table
	- track a given measurement at regular intervals
	- provides you a snapshot of data at a specific time
	- in the meal_card_EOW_snapshot example
		- you have a EOW balance for the meal card
		- you can also have a student and week key
		- the student key can be repeated because the same student can
		  have difference balances at the end of the different weeks

Accumulating Snapshot Table
	- Track the progress of a business process through formally defined stages
	- we want to measure the elapsed time spent in each phase
		- include both completed and in-progress phases
		- can also track other measures as process proceeds
	- introduces concept of multiple relationships from fact table back to 
	  a single dimension table
	- for example, in a financial aid application process, there are many steps that must happen
		- students submits applications, initial screening, prelim decision, final decision, and payment made to student
			- there is some amount of time spent between each process
	
Factless Fact Table
	- record occurrence of transaction that has no measurement
	- record coverage or eligility relationships
	- there is an event that occurs that we want to track
		- but nothing significant to measure about that event
	- student registering for online webinar example
		- track which students register
		- for which webinars
		- track date each student registers for a given webinar
		- track the scheduled date for each webinar
	
	- can have multiple factless fact tables in the same schema


Slowly Changing Dimensions
	- techniques used to manage history within data warehouse
	- multiple techniques based on various history data
	- enables data warehouse to appropriately manage history regardless of policies in transactional applications
	- three main policies for historical data
		- Type 1 (overwrite)
			- overwritre old data; no history retention
			- replace old value with new value
			- same row and column in database table
			- usually a simple update SQL statement
			- common use is to correct erroneous data
		- Type 2 (new row)
			- maintain unlimited history
			- new row added to dimension table
			- complications with reporting and analytics
			- we can add new columns to these kind of tables to include dates 
			  and how current it is
		- Type 3 (new column)
			- maintain limited history
			- add new columns rather than new row to reflect changes
			- "old value" column and "new value" column

SCD type|	Technique					  |	Implications
------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 1	|	"in-place update" ETL pattern |	simplest... but no 
		|								  |	history maintainced
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Type 2  |  Create new dimension table row | most architecturally
	    |  for each new "version" of      | complex... but robust
		|  history						  |	rep of history
----------------------------------------------------------------
Type 3  | Small numbers of dimension      | easily switch back 
        | table columns for multiple      | and fourth between
		| "versions" of history           | "as-is" and "as-was"
		| 								  | reporting... but 
		|								  | limited use cases
