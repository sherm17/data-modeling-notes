4 main types of data warehousing fact tables
	- transanction fact table
	- periodic snapshot fact tables
	- accumulating snapshop fact tables
	- factless fact tables
	
Transaction table:
	- the fact table will usually contain measurements and keys that will reference other 
	  dimensional table
	- for example in a "tuition payment" setting, you will have a tuition_payment_fact table
	  that contains the tuition payment (measurements) and the student/date keys that
	  reference the student and date dimensional tables. 
	  	- the student and date dimensional table each will contain more data on students
	  	  and dates

Periodic Snapshot Fact Table
	- track a given measurement at regular intervals
	- provides you a snapshot of data at a specific time
	- in the meal_card_EOW_snapshot example
		- you have a EOW balance for the meal card
		- you can also have a student and week key
		- the student key can be repeated because the same student can
		  have difference balances at the end of the different weeks

Accumulating Snapshot Table
	- Track the progress of a business process through formally defined stages
	- we want to measure the elapsed time spent in each phase
		- include both completed and in-progress phases
		- can also track other measures as process proceeds
	- introduces concept of multiple relationships from fact table back to 
	  a single dimension table
	- for example, in a financial aid application process, there are many steps that must happen
		- students submits applications, initial screening, prelim decision, final decision, and payment made to student
			- there is some amount of time spent between each process
	
Factless Fact Table
	- record occurrence of transaction that has no measurement
	- record coverage or eligility relationships
	- there is an event that occurs that we want to track
		- but nothing significant to measure about that event
	- student registering for online webinar example
		- track which students register
		- for which webinars
		- track date each student registers for a given webinar
		- track the scheduled date for each webinar
	
	- can have multiple factless fact tables in the same schema
