4 main types of data warehousing fact tables
	- transanction fact table
	- periodic snapshot fact tables
	- accumulating snapshop fact tables
	- factless fact tables
	
Transaction table:
	- the fact table will usually contain measurements and keys that will reference other 
	  dimensional table
	- for example in a "tuition payment" setting, you will have a tuition_payment_fact table
	  that contains the tuition payment (measurements) and the student/date keys that
	  reference the student and date dimensional tables. 
	  	- the student and date dimensional table each will contain more data on students
	  	  and dates

Periodic Snapshot Fact Table
	- provides you a snapshot of data at a specific time
	- in the meal_card_EOW_snapshot example
		- you have a EOW balance for the meal card
		- you can also have a student and week key
		- the student key can be repeated because the same student can
		  have difference balances at the end of the different weeks
